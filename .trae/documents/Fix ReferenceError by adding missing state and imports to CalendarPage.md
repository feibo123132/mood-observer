I will fix the `CalendarPage.tsx` file by adding the missing code that is causing the white screen and errors.

**Plan:**

1.  **Update Imports**: Add `ChevronDown`, `ChevronRight`, `Trees`, and `Map` to the `lucide-react` import statement.
2.  **Add Missing State & Logic**: Define the `expandedSections` state (defaulting both sections to open) and the `toggleSection` helper function inside the component.

This will resolve the `ReferenceError` and ensure the "Forest of Moods" and "Journey of Treasures" sections work as intended.
